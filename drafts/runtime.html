<h2 id="conformance"><span class="secno">1 </span>Conformance</h2>
<p>All diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are
non-normative, as are all sections explicitly marked non-normative.
Everything else in this specification is normative.

<p>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", <!--"SHALL", "SHALL
NOT",--> "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in the normative parts of this document are to be
interpreted as described in RFC2119. For readability, these words do
not appear in all uppercase letters in this specification.
<a href="#refsRFC2119">[RFC2119]</a>

<p>Requirements phrased in the imperative as part of algorithms
(such as "strip any leading space characters" or "return false and
terminate these steps") are to be interpreted with the meaning of the
key word ("must", "should", "may", etc) used in introducing the
algorithm.

<p>Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps
may be implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is
equivalent. (In particular, the algorithms defined in this
specification are intended to be easy to follow, and not intended to
be performant.)

<p id="hardwareLimitations">User agents may impose
implementation-specific limits on otherwise unconstrained inputs,
e.g. to prevent denial of service attacks, to guard against running
out of memory, or to work around platform-specific limitations.

<p>When a method or an attribute is said to call another method or attribute,
the user agent must invoke its internal API for that attribute or method so
that e.g. the author can't change the behavior by overriding attributes or
methods with custom properties or functions in ECMAScript.

<p>Unless otherwise stated, string comparisons are done in a
<span>case-sensitive</span> manner.

<h3 id="dependencies"><span class="secno">1.1 </span>Dependencies</h3>

<p>The IDL fragments in this specification must be interpreted as
required for conforming IDL fragments, as described in the Web IDL
specification. <a href="#refsWEBIDL">[WEBIDL]</a>

<p>Some of the terms used in this specification are defined in
<cite>Web IDL</cite>.
<a href="#refsWEBIDL">[WEBIDL]</a>



<h2 id="design-principles"><span class="secno">2 </span>Design Principles</h2>
<p>The runtime has the following core design principles:
<dl>
  <dt>Installable
  <dd>The user (or a trusted delegate) must make a trust decision to decide to
    install a System Application before it can be used.
  <dt>Uninstallable
  <dd>It must not be possible to create persistent malware with System
    Applications.
  <dt>Offline first
  <dd>System Applications should run offline and should display a reasonable
    user interface without any explicit effort by the developer.  They should
    be able to automatically recover from lost or intermittent connectivity.
    They don't need to provide their full functionality when offline, but they
    should not be obviously or irrecoverably broken.
  <dt>Outside of the browser
  <dd>The runtime launches System Applications outside of the browser and
    should not provide traditional browser "chrome" such as
    back/forward navigation buttons or a location bar.
  <dt>Powerful
  <dd>The runtime provides System Applications with APIs that are inherently
    dangerous and have potential privacy and security ramifications.  The
    runtime must provide a trust mechanism whereby either the user explicitly
    chooses to trust a potentially dangerous application or a third party
    vouches for the safety of the application.
  <dt>Limited
  <dd>The APIs provided by the runtime are segmented according to a number of
    fine-grained permissions.  If an application has not been granted a
    permission, the runtime must prevent the application from using the
    associated APIs.  Developers should minimize the permission they request
    for their applications.
  <dt>Sandboxed
  <dd>System applications must be isolated from other applications and the
    underlying operating system except for via explicitly defined, narrow,
    typed, mediated APIs.
  <dt>Resistant
  <dd>The runtime must be resistant to vulnerabilities that could lead to
    remote security exploits.  For example, the runtime should make it
    difficult for attackers to mount a cross-site scripting attack against
    System Applications.
  <dt>Ephemeral
  <dd>A System Application must be prepared to be terminated at any moment
    without notification.  The application should be able to restore itself to
    its previous state quickly and easily.  The runtime must prevent a system
    application from delaying, prompting or canceling the application's
    termination.
  <dt>Verifiable
  <dd>A third party (such as a broker, store, or market) must be able to verify
    the code of a System Application and all of the future updates that the
    third party delivers to the user.  Unverified code may be permitted, but
    such code must be sandboxed and must not receive privileges for dangerous
    APIs.
  <dt>Revokable
  <dd>A third party (such as a broker, store, or market) must be able to revoke
    and disable a System Application that the third party provided to the
    users, even after the user has installed the application.
</dl>



<h2 id="application-lifecycle"><span class="secno">3 </span>Application Lifecycle</h2>

<h3 id="installation"><span class="secno">3.1 </span>Installation</h3>

<p>System Applications must define the complete set of permissions or
capabilities that they require or might request at runtime.  This list is set
at install time and must not be changed until the application is updated.
Applications must be <dfn id="concept-install" title="concept-install">installed</dfn> before they can
be run with these permissions.  This installation acts as a <dfn id="concept-trust-gesture" title="concept-trust-gesture">trust gesture</dfn> and may be initiated either by
the user or by a trusted delegate (e.g. operating system, device maker, device
distributor, or enterprise policy).  User-initiated installation should include
a confirmation step to mitigate the risk that a vulnerability in the runtime
might cause automatic installation.

<p>This document does not impose requirements on what information, of any,
should be presented as part of the installation experience.  It is up to the
runtime vendor to determine how best to assess the trust level and risk level
of an application and how or if to convey that information to the user.  In its
simplest form, a confirmation might simply be an install button in some
protected part of the runtime user interface.  A more typical install
experience might present an "are you sure?" confirmation dialog that
summarizes the permissions requested by the application.

<h3 id="event-page"><span class="secno">3.2 </span>Event Page</h3>

<p>During installation, the application must define an <dfn id="concept-event-page" title="concept-event-page">event page</dfn>.  The event page is a resource within
the application similar to other resources but with a few important
differences:
<ol>
  <li>When running the event page, the runtime must not display display the
    event page to the user. Instead, the page runs in the background.
  <li>The event page is a singleton: there must be exactly one event page per
    application.
  <li>The runtime may close the event page in certain circumstances.  When an
    event page is not executing any script, has no pending callbacks, and no
    open windows, the runtime should close the event page.  In addition, the
    runtime may close the event page in order to reduce resource consumption.
</ol>

<h3 id="launch"><span class="secno">3.3 </span>Launch</h3>

<p>When the user initiates application startup, the runtime <dfn id="concept-launches" title="concept-launches">launches</dfn> the application by running these steps:
<ol>
  <li>Instantiate the application's event page.
  <li>Spin the event loop until the event page's <code>DOMContentLoaded</code>
    event finishes firing. FIXME: Is this correct?
  <li><a class="external" href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/webappapis.html#queue-a-task">Queue a task</a> to <a class="external" href="http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/domcore/raw-file/tip/Overview.html#concept-event-fire" title="concept-event-fire">Fire an event</a> named
    <code>launch</code> at the event page's <code>window</code> object.
</ol>

<p>Notice that the runtime does not create any visible windows when launching
an application.  The application can choose whether to display any visible
windows when handling the <code>launch</code> event.

<h3 id="event-initiated-startup"><span class="secno">3.4 </span>Event-initiated startup</h3>

<p>The runtime may start the application for the purpose of delivering events
from the system.  For example, a system-level service might ask an email
application to send an email on its behalf.  To handle these causes, the
runtime <dfn id="concept-background-launch" title="concept-background-launch">launches the application in the
background</dfn> to handle an event <var>event</var> by running these steps:
<ol>
  <li>If the application's event page is not currently instantiated:
    <ol>
      <li>Instantiate the application's event page.
      <li>Spin the event loop until the event page's
        <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> event finishes firing. FIXME: Is this
        correct?
    </ol>
  <li><a class="external" href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/webappapis.html#queue-a-task">Queue a task</a> to <a class="external" href="http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/domcore/raw-file/tip/Overview.html#concept-event-fire" title="concept-event-fire">Fire</a> <var>event</var>
    at the event page's <code>window</code> object.
</ol>

<p>The runtime should not indicate that applications launched are running in
the runtime's primary user interface.  For example, the application should not
appear in the operating system's task switcher.  The runtime may indicate that
applications launched in this way are running in secondary user interface
elements, such as a task manager or battery profiler.

<p>Applications launched in this way can run for extended periods of time
without being visible, for example, if they receive events frequently.
Typically, applications should handle these events quickly and consume a
minimal amount of resources when running in the background.

<h3 id="creating-windows"><span class="secno">3.5 </span>Creating Windows</h3>

<p>An event page may create one or more windows.  By default, these windows are
created with a script connection to the event page and are directly scriptable
by the event page.  FIXME: Do we want to specify an interface for creating an
managing windows in this document?

<h3 id="termination"><span class="secno">3.6 </span>Termination</h3>

<p>The application can <dfn id="concept-terminate" title="concept-terminate">terminate</dfn> in a number
of situations:
<ul>
  <li>The application may terminate itself by calling <code>window.close()</code>.
  <li>The runtime may terminate the application if the application is idle
    (i.e., not executing script, has no pending callbacks, and no open windows).
  <li>The runtime may terminate the application to reduce overall resource
    consumption by the runtime.
</ul>

<p>When an application is terminated, the runtime must close all of the
application's pages, including the event page and any visible pages. The
runtime must not let the application show down or cancel termination, including
prompting the user.  Applications should automatically save their state
periodically to protect against data loss.

<p>The runtime should avoid terminating the active, focused application if at
all possible. However, the runtime may terminate that application as a last
resort (e.g., due to resource exhaustion or bad behavior).

<h3 id="update"><span class="secno">3.7 </span>Update</h3>

<p>The runtime may update applications whenever the application's event page is
not instantiated.  When launched, the runtime must use the latest installed
version of the application.

<p>When updating, an application may request a change in its set of
permissions. The runtime may require a trust gesture from the user to approve
these changes.

<h3 id="uninstallation"><span class="secno">3.8 </span>Uninstallation</h3>

<p>The runtime must let the user <dfn id="concept-uninstall" title="concept-uninstall">uninstall</dfn>
applications. If the application is running when uninstalled, the runtime must
terminate the application. After uninstallation, there should be no
code executing or private data stored by the runtime.

<p>Uninstallation can lead to data loss because the runtime terminates the
application without warning and deletes the application's private data. The
runtime should warn the user about these hazards before uninstalling the
application.

<p>The runtime must prevent applications from persisting itself or a derived
application after being uninstalled.  This requirement helps protect the user
from persistent malware.



<h2 id="conventions"><span class="secno">4 </span>Conventions</h2>

<p>Functions must not block the main thread of the application.  If the
function can execute using cached in-memory or computed values, the function
may return values syncronously or throw exceptions.

<p>In other cases, functions must be asynchronous.  Asynchronous functions must
have no return value, throw no exceptions, and the last argument of the
function should be a callback.  The callback must be called exactly once when
the function execution has completed, whether or not the function completes
successfully or generates data.

<p>Typically, callbacks will take an error object as their first argument.  If
the function does not complete successfully, the error argument will be
non-<code>null</code>.  Otherwise, the error argument will be
<code>null</code>.

<p>Each functions is associated with one or more privileges.  These privileges
vary in grainularity, ranging from granting access to entire modules,
interfaces, or functions.  In some cases, a privilege might grant permission to
call a function with a subset of its possible arguments.

<p>The runtime may grant these privileges either when the user installs the
application or when the application requests access at runtime (or some
combination thereof).

<p>Interfaces should be visible and callable regardless of whether the
application has the requisite permission.  If the application does not have
permission to call a function, the runtime should generate a permission error
(FIXME: Citation needed).  Applications should be prepared to handle these
errors.

<p>Regardless of the level of privilege, applications must be allowed to make
irreversible changes to the underlying operating system.  For example, For
example, applications must not be able write to arbitrary parts of the
file system without a specific user action.

<p>Applications must not be able to interfere with other applications.
Interaction between apps must be mediated by either explicit communication
channels or shared typed storage (such as a <code>MessageChannel</code> or a
contacts API).



<h2 id="differences-from-the-web-platform"><span class="secno">5 </span>Differences from the Web Platform</h2>

<p>The System Applications Runtime is based on the web platform, but has some
differences.  Some features have been added and some have been removed.  Other
features are used in the same way but have different behavior behavior
differences.

<h3 id="differences"><span class="secno">5.1 </span>Differences</h3>

<p>Each application must run in single origin <a href="#refsRFC6454">[RFC6454]</a>,
separate from the origins used by other applications and web sites.

<p>Each application must have <dfn id="concept-isolated-storage" title="concept-isolated-storage">isolated
storage</dfn>, a separate copy of each type of persistent storage, including
cookies and databases, from other applications and from the browser. For
example, if the application makes an HTTP request for
<code>https://example.com/</code> and the <code>example.com</code> server
responds with a <code>Set-Cookie</code> header <a href="#refsRFC6265">[RFC6265]</a>, then subsequent HTTP requests to
<code>example.com</code> made by the application will include the cookie, but
requests made by other applications, or by the browser, will not include the
cookie, even if those requests are for <code>example.com</code>.

<p>The runtime must allow applications to issue <code>XMLHttpRequests</code> to
every <code>http</code> and <code>https</code> URI without using Cross-Origin
Resource Sharing <a href="#refsCORS">[CORS]</a>.  In particular, cookie
should be enabled during these requests, but, due to isolated storage, the
cookie jar for each host must be empty when the application is installed.

<p>The runtime calls a callback in the application when the runtime is about to
terminate the application.  (FIXME: Should this information bein the lifecycle
section?) Once the runtime calls this callback, the runtime must hide the
application and prevent the appplciation from presenting any user interface
elements to the user.  After five seconds, the runtime will terminate the
application.  Applications should use this time to complete their current
tasks, but applications should not rely upon this notification to prevent data
less because the runtime may terminate the application without notice if
necessary. Instead, applications should use this notification to clean up
shared resource gracefully, such as disconnecting from remote servers.

<p>The runtime must let applications open multiple windows without explicit
user gestures.  When opening a window, the opener is given a reference to the
window's <code>DOMWindow</code> object. The runtime must provide an API for
enumerating all of the application's open windows (FIXME: Spec this API).

<h3 id="disabled-features"><span class="secno">5.2 </span>Disabled Features</h3>

<p>The runtime must prevent the application from loading remote subresources
using mechanisms that do not have a reasonable offline user experience or
programmatic error handling.  For example, the runtime must prevent the
application from loading remote scripts, workers, iframes, images, and style
sheets.  FIXME: Nail down this list.

<p>The runtime must allow the application to load remove audio and video
resource.  FIXME: Is this requirement based on some rationale or should we just
have a list of what is and is not allowed?

<p>FIXME: Fill out this section.
<ul>
  <li>Navigation.  Links open up with the system web browser.  window.history
    and window.location are disabled.
  <li>Synchronous, blocking APIs.  (document.cookie, localstorage, sync XHR,
    alert, confirm, prompt, print and showModalDialog)
  <li>Non-sandboxed plugins.
  <li>WebSQL.
  <li>Page finalizers (unload and beforeunload events)
  <li>Browser "chrome" APIs (window.locationbar, window.menubar,
    window.external, window,sidebar, etc.).
  <li>form submission.
</ul>
